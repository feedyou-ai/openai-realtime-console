# OpenAI Realtime Console

This is an example application showing how to use the [OpenAI Realtime API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime) with [WebRTC](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-webrtc).

## Installation and usage

Before you begin, you'll need an OpenAI API key - [create one in the dashboard here](https://platform.openai.com/settings/api-keys). Create a `.env` file from the example file and set your API key in there:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Running this application locally requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to be installed. Install dependencies for the application with:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the Vite development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This should start the console application on [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).

## Previous WebSockets version

The previous version of this application that used WebSockets on the client (not recommended in client-side browsers) [can be found here](https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-console/tree/websockets).
